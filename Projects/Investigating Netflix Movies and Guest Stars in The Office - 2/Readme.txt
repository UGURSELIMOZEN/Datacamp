Project Tools

In this project I used Python with pandas for  exploratory data analysis and data visualization (matplotlib) for the history of the sitcom The Office.



Project Description

In this project, I’ll apply the skills with Python to solve a real-world data science problem.By pressing “watch next episode” to discover if 
Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from 
lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib also gaining experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis.This project will 
allow me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data.



Project Tasks

Bringing together a wide variety of skills from Python to prepare and plot data on the history of the sitcom The Office.
