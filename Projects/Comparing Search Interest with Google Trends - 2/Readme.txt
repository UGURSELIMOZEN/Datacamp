Project Tools

In this project I used Python with pandas for time series data analysis and data visualization (plot , subplot , rolling average plot , pct_change plot) 
for Google trend with search interest analysis.


Project Description

Time series data is everywhere; from temperature records, to unemployment rates, to the S&P 500 Index. Another rich source of time series data is Google Trends, 
where you can freely download the search interest of terms and topics from as far back as 2004. This project dives into manipulating and visualizing Google Trends 
data to find unique insights.In the unguided variant, you will analyze the worldwide search interest of five major internet browsers to calculate metrics such as 
rolling average and percentage change.


Project Objective

Analyze web browser market share between 2004-2020 using Google Trends and time series manipulation.
