Project Tools

In this project I used Python with pandas for  exploratory data analysis and data visualization (matplotlib) for Investigating Netflix Movies.



Project Description

In this project, I’ll apply the skills with Python to solve a real-world data science problem.By pressing “watch next episode” to discover if 
Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from 
lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib also gaining experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis.This project will 
allow me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data.

2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
